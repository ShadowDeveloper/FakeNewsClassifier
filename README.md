# FakeNewsClassifier
A classifier trained on around 70k news articles, aimed at distinguishing real news from fake news.
It is an EmbeddingBag-based text classifier made with PyTorch.

Data used is [Gonzalo √Ålvarez's *Fake News*](https://huggingface.co/datasets/GonzaloA/fake_news) and [Mohammad Javad Pirhadi's *Fake News Detection Dataset (English)*](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mohammadjavadpirhadi/fake-news-detection-dataset-english).
I could not find any specific citation to use.

Check [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/ShadowProgrammer/FakeNewsClassifier) for the trained model (3.03GB).
